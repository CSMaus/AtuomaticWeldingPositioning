1. Make sure the Python3.9._ is installed. You can check it in Control Panel -> Programms and Features (제어판 → 프로그램 및 기능)
1.1 if the Python is not installed, you can download it and install from official web site (I use 3.9.7 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)

NOTE: if other version of python is installed you can try to install requirements and run the programm before reinstalling python.


2. To install all required libraries open command prompt in this folder and run command "pip install -r requirements.txt"

3. To run the programm, you cam run command "python main_gui.py"
Make shure that the camera is connected before running programm.

4. To stop programm you can close the window or press "Crtl + C" in command window
